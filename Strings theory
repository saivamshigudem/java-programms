String  are datatypes in java which stores collection of words or we can say collection of char;

Strings are two types 
1) mutable String
2)immutable Strings

1-->mutable strings are those which can be changed after the giving a value tp it 
ex : String a =" vamshi";
 a = "rocky";
 sop(a);
 output:
 rocky
 
 2--> immutable strings are 
 StringBuffer
 StringBuilder
 
 We can write in a object form .Strings are object in java .
 String abc = new String("Hello World");

the strings memory is allocated in the heap memory .

the heap memory has the stringpool and there in memory is allocated for it . where it doesnt allow duplicates value in it.

when you create a string with a new keyword it will alloacted in the heap but not in the stringpool where duplicates are allowed.
