1. consider the following program 
   public class question{
     public static void main(String []args){
        for(int i=7;i<3;i-=5){
           system.out.println(i++i);
        }
     }
   }
   what will be the output of the program??
   a) 15
   b) 12
   c) 14
   d) 10
   
   the answer = 15
   
2.  following is a piece of code where some parts of code are the missing ??
  public class question{
     public static void main(String []args){

        for(int i=1; i<= n; i++)
        product *=1;
           system.out.println(product);
           }
         }

     public static void main(String []args){
        int n = Interger.parseInt(args[0]);
        int v = 1;
        while (v<=n/2)
        v = 2*v;
           system.out.println(v);
           }
         }
   
   what will be output of the program if it is executed? let n=10
   a) 5
   b) 20
   c) 8
   d) 10
   
   the solution = c

        for(int i=0;i<5;i++){
           system.out.println(f);
           f = f+g;
           g = f-g;
        }
     }
